# 🚀 Frameworks Setup Guide

This guide provides detailed information about the `setup-eslint` script, which is a key part of initializing the TypeScript Full-Stack Template. The script is designed to configure your project based on your chosen frontend framework (React, Angular, or Vue) and set up a Node.js backend.

## 🛠️ What the Script Does

1. **Frontend Setup**: The script starts by asking if you want to set up a frontend. If you choose 'yes', it then prompts you to select between React, Angular, and Vue.

   - Depending on your choice, the script installs the necessary dependencies for the chosen framework and sets up the ESLint and TypeScript configurations tailored for that framework.
   - For React, it installs React-specific packages and sets up ESLint with React and TypeScript rules.
   - For Angular, it installs Angular core packages, configures ESLint with Angular-specific rules, and sets up TypeScript for Angular.
   - For Vue, it installs Vue and its associated tooling, along with setting up ESLint and TypeScript configurations suitable for Vue.

2. **Backend Setup**: The script also asks if you want to set up a Node.js backend. If you confirm, it proceeds to set up a basic Node.js backend environment.

   - It installs Express and sets up ESLint and TypeScript configurations optimized for a Node.js backend environment.

3. **Execution**: The script executes commands in the respective directories (`frontend` and `backend`) to ensure that the environment is correctly set up for development.

4. **File Creation**: The script generates configuration files like `.eslintrc.yml` and `tsconfig.json` based on the selections made. These files are crucial for maintaining consistent coding standards and leveraging TypeScript's features.

## 🌐 How It All Works Together

### Frontend Frameworks (React, Angular, Vue)

- **React ⚛️**: A library for building user interfaces, handling the view layer for web and mobile apps.
- **Angular 🅰️**: A platform and framework for building single-page client applications, providing a comprehensive solution for the frontend.
- **Vue 🟢**: A progressive framework for building user interfaces, focusing on the view layer, making it easy to pick up and integrate.

### TypeScript 🔵

- TypeScript is used across the full stack, enhancing JavaScript with type safety, leading to more robust and maintainable code.

### Backend (Node.js) 🟩

- Node.js serves as the runtime environment on the server, handling HTTP requests, interacting with databases, and executing server-side logic.

### Integration 🔄

- The frontend communicates with the backend, sending and receiving data, which is then displayed to the user. TypeScript ensures consistency and reliability in the data structures and responses exchanged between the frontend and backend.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you can customize the TypeScript Full-Stack Template to fit your project's needs, ensuring a robust and efficient development process.
